        The Death Sandwich is the flagship product of Death Kwon Do Pizza and
        Subs and appears in the episode Sandwich of Death. The recipe was
        created in an ancient dojo thousands of years ago, and was a closely
        guarded secret. Eventually, Sensai took the recipe and made it into a
        commercial product, and thus his master holds a grudge.

          Combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, egg, bbq sauce salt and pepper
          in a bowl. Mix well by hand. Form balls a little larger than ping pong
          balls. Set in the fridge for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fill a pot with oil and heat to 375 degrees F. Fry the meatballs until
          they are fully browned. Take the meat balls out of the pot and throw
          into an oven at 400 degrees F for an additional 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slice the bread in half. Add heated marinara sauce to the base of the
          bottom half of the bread. Add the slices of ham. Top the ham with the
          meat balls.
