        This is a relatively easy recipe to make and several different additions
        or subtractions to the ingredients list can be made to sate the culinary
        palate of your choosing. Kirby’s Super Spicy Curry has made an
        appearance in many of the Kirby games, each iteration looking a little
        different in style but giving the same fire breath style power-up to our
        hungry hippo hero.

        <li>1 lb. chicken, cut into medium sized chunks</li>

        <li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>
        <li>4 pods green cardamom</li>

    <!-- Steps -->
    <div class="StepsMenu">
      <h2>Steps:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Skin and cut your potatoes into inch sized squares, dice your onions,
          peel and chop your carrots, mince the garlic, and cut your chicken up
          into chunks. Prepare your spicy peppers by putting on gloves and
          cutting them into small bits. Be careful with how spicy these can get
          - wash your cutting board thoroughly and dispose of the gloves - avoid
          contacting your skin or anywhere on your face with your hands.
        </li>
        <li>
          To prepare the curry, heat vegetable oil in a pan and begin sautéing
          the onions. Add in the garlic, mix it all together and allow to soften
          for a few minutes. Add in your garam masala, curry powder, cardamom,
          cinnamon stick, and bay leaf and stir until the ingredients are evenly
          coated. Add in your water and your chicken and cook until the meat is
          about half finished. Add in your potatoes and carrots and combine.
          Cover with a lid and cook on medium low heat for another 20-30
          minutes. Once the liquid has been reduced, pour in your coconut milk
          and combine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add in your final flavor with curry roux, spicy peppers, and mix it
          all together until the roux has melted. You can optionally flambe your
          curry for show if you’d like to get that spicy effect (and a slight
          flavor addition from the alcohol). Pour some brandy onto to the top of
          the mixture and wait for it to begin to bubble. Light it with a flame
          (using a long matchstick or long reach lighter) and allow the flame to
          fully burn out before removing the curry from the heat.
        </li>
      </ol>
